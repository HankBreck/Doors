# Doors
Infinite command line game made with Python

Three doors appear in the game with two adjectives describing it. The scarier the adjectives, the higher the chance that the Scuvasz (the monster of the game) will be behind the door. Treasure can be earned from doors too. The scarier the door, the more treasure is behind the door.
